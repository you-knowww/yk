mochimochimochi

The following is a psa for anyone expecting to be anywhere near [fujisawa station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fujisawa_Station).

Fujisawa station contains a fantastic mochi stand obscured from the internet. At least as far as i can tell.

It's labelled

***MOCHI***
***MOCHI***
***MOCHI***

and its in the hallway between the main jr line and enoshima line.

This was my best and favorite food from our 2 week tour across japan.

Mochimochimochi specializes in mugwort mochi. I bought a grip of mugwort mochi for the purpose of trying something new and the excuse to say mugwort a lot. In honesty it was novel and tasty but not the best variety available. Still good, still recommend mugwort.

They have many flavors but we only tried a few. Stawberry was incredible. My spouse bought dango so we also had an excuse to yell, "DANG YO" at one another. It was also very good.

Everything except the sign is in japanese so we had to use our phones to read flavors.

While we were waiting for the train from fujisawa to yokyo we had 7 minutes to spare so i hustled off the platform back to the stand to buy even more mochimochimochi.

I live in portland oregon and there is no mochi joint anywhere here. Rumors are a church across town sells mochi but the bike ride isn't worth a ***maybe***.

Now im googling diy mochi because mochimochimochi made a new man out of me. And he wants mochi.
